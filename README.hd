# Project Title

This is a collection of scores for various songs, some original works, some arrangements of existing works, for Native American Flute.

## Getting Started

These songs are kept in Music-xml so that they can be imported into various programs used for writing and editing musical scores.  Some examples are MuseScore from musescore.com; Score Cloud from scorecloud.com as well as several of the higher end systems used for engraving/publishing.

### Prerequisites

Simply have a software program that can import and edit Music-xml files. These should be Operating System agnostic, so any software on any os, as long as it reads and edits Music-xml.

### Installing
